To resize image, or to create thumbnail, jimp package on npm is useful.

INSTALLATION
    npm install jimp --save

PACKAGE INFO AT
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp

USE
1. Use the read method of jimp to supply the path of the image and a callback that return an error on error or a jimp image file.
    jimp.read(path_to_file, function (error, image) {
        // implementation code
    });
2. Jimp comes with a bunch of methods. To resize, we use the resize method on the image obtained from the callback.
    jimp.read(path_to_file, function (error, image) {
        if (error) return console.error(error);
        image
        .resize(100, 100); // syntax: resize(width, height)
    });
3. Followed by the write method, we can write the file to disk.
    image
    .resize(100, 100)
    .write(path_to_save_file);
4. We can also get the buffer of the resized file by using the getBuffer method.
    image
    .resize(100, 100)
    .getBuffer(mime, callback); // mimetype for png: 'image/png' or use the jimp.MIME_PNG.
