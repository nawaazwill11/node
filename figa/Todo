=> Create a version maintainer that takes an object as a parameter. This object contains the names of the files as indices that needs to be modified. These files will be copied to a directory named versions and a sub-directory with name of each filename will be created. The files will be copied to their directory and a file will be created and named with 'v' followed by the number of version of that file (which can be derived from the name of the previous file. Example: if the name of the previous file is v1, the new file created will be name v2). The maintainer script will also accept another optional boolean parameter for modifying the main files (default will be false).
=> Refactor router code by creating functions that handle request file availability on disk and response mechanism. Reduce redundant code.
